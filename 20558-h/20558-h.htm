INTRODUCTION</a></h4>


<p>For modern readers, one of the most intriguing scenes in Daniel
Defoe's <i>Moll Flanders</i> (1722) occurs during the courtship of Moll
by the man who is to become her third husband. Aware that the eligible
men of her day have little interest in prospective wives with small or
nonexistent fortunes, Moll slyly devises a plan to keep her relative
poverty a secret from the charming and (as&nbsp;she has every reason to
believe) wealthy plantation owner who has fallen in love with her. To
divert attention from her own financial condition, she repeatedly
suggests that he has been courting her only for her money. Again and
again he protests his love. Over and over she pretends to doubt his
sincerity.</p>

<p>After a series of exhausting confrontations, Moll's lover begins what
is to us a novel kind of dialogue:</p>

<div class = "block">

<p>One morning he pulls off his diamond ring and writes upon the glass
of the sash in my chamber this line:</p>

<p class = "inset3">You I love and you alone.</p>

<p>I read it and asked him to lend me the ring, with which I wrote under
it thus:</p>

<p class = "inset3">And so in love says every one.</p>

<p>He takes his ring again and writes another line thus:</p>

<p class = "inset3">Virtue alone is an estate.</p>

<p>I borrowed it again, and I wrote under it:</p>

<p class = "inset3">But money's virtue, gold is fate.<a class = "tag"
name = "tag1" id = "tag1" href = "#note1">1</a></p>

</div>

<p>After a number of additional thrusts and counterthrusts of this sort,
Moll and her lover come to terms and are married.</p>

<p>The latter half of the twentieth century has seen a steady growth of
serious scholarly interest in graffiti. Sociologists, psychologists, and
historians have increasingly turned to the impromptu "scratchings" of
both the educated and the uneducated as indicators of the general mental
health and political stability of specific populations.<a class = "tag"
name = "tag2" id = "tag2" href = "#note2">2</a> Although most of us are
familiar with at least a few of these studies and all of us have
observed numerous examples of this species of writing on the walls of
our cities and the rocks of our
<span class = "pagenum intro">iv</span>
national parks, we are not likely, before encountering this scene in
<i>Moll Flanders</i>, to have ever before come into contact with
graffiti produced with such an elegant writing implement.</p>

<p>Glass being fragile and diamonds being relatively rare, it is not
surprising that few examples of graffiti produced by the method employed
by Moll and her lover are known to us today. Interestingly enough, we
do, however, have available to us a variety of Renaissance and
eighteenth-century written materials suggesting that the practice of
using a diamond to write ephemeral statements on window glass was far
less rare in those periods than we might expect. Holinshed, for example,
tells us that in 1558 when Elizabeth was released from imprisonment at
Woodstock, she taunted her enemies by writing</p>

<div class = "block">

<p>these verses with hir diamond in a glasse window verie legiblie as
here followeth:</p>

<p class = "inset3">Much suspected by me,<br>
Nothing prooued can be:<br>
Quoth Elizabeth prisoner.<a class = "tag" name = "tag3" id = "tag3" href
= "#note3">3</a></p>

</div>

<p>And in John Donne's "A Valediction: of my Name in the Window," we
find two lovers in a situation reminiscent of that of the scene I
previously quoted from <i>Moll Flanders</i>. Using a diamond, the poet,
before beginning an extended journey, scratches his name on a window
pane in the house of his mistress. Here is the first stanza of the
poem:</p>

<div class = "block">

<p class = "inset5">My name engrav'd herein,</p>
<p class = "inset3 nospace">Doth contribute my firmnesse to this
glasse,</p>
<p class = "inset5 nospace">Which, ever since that charme, hath
beene</p>
<p class = "inset5 nospace">As hard, as that which grav'd it, was;</p>
<p class = "inset3 nospace">Thine eyes will give it price enough, to
mock</p>
<p class = "inset5 nospace">The diamonds of either rock.<a class = "tag"
name = "tag4" id = "tag4" href = "#note4">4</a></p>

</div>

<p>While he is absent, the characters he has cut in the glass will, the
poet hopes, magically defend his mistress against the seductive
entreaties of his rivals.</p>

<p>In 1711 in a satiric letter to <i>The Spectator</i>, John Hughes
poked fun at a number of aspiring poets who had recently attempted to
create works of art by utilizing what Hughes called "Contractions or
Expedients for Wit." One Virtuoso (a&nbsp;mathematician) had, for
example, "thrown the Art of Poetry into a short Problem, and contrived
Tables by which any one without knowing a Word of
<span class = "pagenum intro">v</span>
Grammar or Sense, may to his great Comfort, be able to compose or rather
erect <i>Latin</i> Verses." Equally ridiculous to Hughes, and more
relevant to the concerns of this introduction, was the practice of
another poet of his acquaintance: "I&nbsp;have known a Gentleman of
another Turn of Humour, who, despising the Name of an Author, never
printed his Works, but contracted his Talent, and by the help of a very
fine Diamond which he wore on his little Finger, was a considerable Poet
upon Glass. He had a very good Epigrammatick Wit; and there was not a
Parlour or Tavern Window where he visited or dined ... which did not
receive some Sketches or Memorials of it. It was his Misfortune at last
to lose his Genius and his Ring to a Sharper at Play; and he has not
attempted to make a Verse since."<a class = "tag" name = "tag5" id =
"tag5" href = "#note5">5</a></p>

<p>But "Epigrammatick Wits" of this sort were not universally despised
in the eighteenth century. In 1727 in a "critical dissertation prefix'd"
to <i>A Collection of Epigrams</i>, the anonymous editor of the work
argued that the epigram itself "is a species of Poetry, perhaps, as old
as any other whatsoever: it has receiv'd the approbation of almost all
ages and nations...." In the book proper, he found room for a number of
epigrams which he evidently copied from London window panes. Here is an
example:</p>


<div class = "block">

<h5>CLX.</h5>

<h5><i>To a Lady, on seeing some Verses in Praise of her, on a Pane of
Glass.</i></h5>

<p class = "inset2">Let others, brittle beauties of a year,</p>
<p class = "inset2 nospace">See their frail names, and lovers vows writ
here;</p>
<p class = "inset2 nospace">Who sings thy solid worth and spotless
fame,</p>
<p class = "inset2 nospace">On purest adamant should cut thy name:</p>
<p class = "inset2 nospace">Then would thy fame be from oblivion
sav'd;</p>
<p class = "inset2 nospace">On thy own heart my vows must be
engrav'd.</p>

</div>

<p>One of the epigrams in this collection suggests that, unlike Moll's
lover and Hughes's poet, some affluent authors had even acquired
instruments specifically designed to facilitate the practice of writing
poetry on glass:</p>

<div class = "block">

<h5><i>Written on a Glass by a Gentleman, who borrow'd the Earl of
<em>CHESTERFIELD</em>'s Diamond Pencil.</i></h5>
<p class = "inset2">Accept a miracle, instead of <i>wit</i>;</p>
<p class = "inset2 nospace">See two dull lines by <i>Stanhope's</i>
pencil writ.<a class = "tag" name = "tag6" id = "tag6" href =
"#note6">6</a></p>

</div>

<p>As the title of this epigram also suggests, window panes were not the
only surfaces considered appropriate for such writing. A&nbsp;favorite
<span class = "pagenum intro">vi</span>
alternate surface was that of the toasting glass. The practice of
toasting the beauty of young ladies had originated at the town of Bath
during the reign of Charles II. By the beginning of the eighteenth
century, the members of some social clubs had developed complex toasting
rituals which involved the inscription of the name of the lady to be
honored on a drinking glass suitable for that purpose. In 1709 an issue
of <i>The Tatler</i> described the process in some detail:</p>

<div class = "block">
<p>that happy virgin, who is received and drunk to at their meetings,
has no more to do in this life but to judge and accept of the first good
offer. The manner of her inauguration is much like that of the choice of
a doge in Venice: it is performed by balloting; and when she is so
chosen, she reigns indisputably for that ensuing year; but must be
elected a&#x2011;new to prolong her empire a moment beyond it. When she
is regularly chosen, her name is written with a diamond on a
drinking-glass.<a class = "tag" name = "tag7" id = "tag7" href =
"#note7">7</a></p>
</div>

<p>Perhaps the most famous institution practicing this kind of ceremony
in the eighteenth century was the Kit-Kat Club. In 1716 Jacob Tonson,
a&nbsp;member of that club, published "Verses Written for the
Toasting-Glasses of the Kit-Kat Club" in the fifth part of his
<i>Miscellany</i>. Space limitations will not permit extensive
quotations from this collection, but the toast for Lady Carlisle is
alone sufficient to prove that complete epigrams were at times engraved
upon the drinking glasses belonging to this club:</p>

<div class = "block">
<p class = "inset2">She o'er all Hearts and Toasts must reign,</p>
<p class = "inset2 nospace">Whose Eyes outsparkle bright Champaign;</p>
<p class = "inset2 nospace">Or (when she will vouchsafe to smile,)</p>
<p class = "inset2 nospace">The Brilliant that now writes
<i>Carlisle</i>.<a class = "tag" name = "tag8" id = "tag8" href =
"#note8">8</a></p>
</div>

<p>Part I of <i>The Merry-Thought: or, The Glass-Window and Bog-House
Miscellany</i> was almost certainly published for the first time in
1731. Arthur E. Case (<i>Bibliography of English Poetical
Miscellanies</i>, 1521-1750) notes that this pamphlet was listed in the
register of books in the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> for October 1731.<a
class = "tag" name = "tag9" id = "tag9" href = "#note9">9</a> An instant
success with the reading public, second and third editions of the
pamphlet, the third "with very Large Additions and Alterations," were
also published in 1731.<a class = "tag" name = "tag10" id = "tag10" href
= "#note10">10</a> Because, as its title-page declared, the third and
last edition was the fullest of the three, a&nbsp;copy of that edition
has been chosen for reproduction here.<a class = "tag" name = "tag11" id
= "tag11" href = "#note11">11</a></p>

<p>The title-page of Part I of <i>The Merry-Thought</i> states that the
contents of the pamphlet had been taken from "Original Manuscripts
written in <i>Diamond</i> by Persons of the first Rank and Figure
<span class = "pagenum intro">vii</span>
in <i>Great Britain</i>" and that they had been "Faithfully Transcribed
from the Drinking-Glasses and Windows in the several noted
<i>Taverns</i>, <i>Inns</i>, and other <i>Publick Places</i> in this
Nation. Amongst which are intermixed the Lucubrations of the polite Part
of the World, written upon Walls in Bog-houses, <i>&amp;c.</i>" These
statements suggest one of the principal leveling strategies of the
pamphlet as a whole: the nobility and the rich, whatever their
advantages otherwise, must, like the lowest amongst us, make use of
privies; and, in the process, they are just as likely as their <ins
class = "correction" title = "text reads 'brethern'">brethren</ins> of
the lower classes to leave their marks on the walls of those
conveniences.</p>

<p>A number of the verses included in the pamphlet continue the leveling
process. One in particular (p.&nbsp;20) adopts the principal strategy
employed on the title-page:</p>

<div class = "block">
<p class = "inset2"><i>From the Temple Bog-House.</i></p>
<p class = "inset2">No Hero looks so fierce to Fight,</p>
<p class = "inset2 nospace">As does the Man who strains to sh-te.</p>
</div>

<p>Others suggest that sexual relations are essentially leveling
activities. Here (p.&nbsp;24) is an example:</p>

<div class = "block">
<p class = "inset2"><i>Toy, at Hampton-Court</i>, 1708.</p>
<p class = "inset2">D---n <i>Molley H---ns</i> for her Pride,</p>
<p class = "inset2 nospace">She'll suffer none but Lords to ride:</p>
<p class = "inset2 nospace">But why the Devil should I care,</p>
<p class = "inset2 nospace">Since I can find another Mare?</p>

<p class = "inset5"><i>L.M. August.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Another target of the pamphlet was <i>The Spectator</i> in general
and Addison in particular. In his dedication, J.&nbsp;Roberts first
insists that the graffiti in his collection are notable examples of
wit.<a class = "tag" name = "tag12" id = "tag12" href = "#note12">12</a>
<!-- A poll of several 6th-grade classes backs up his assertion ;-) -->
He next goes out of his way to associate the contents of <i>The
Merry-Thought</i> with <i>The Spectator</i>:</p>

<div class = "block">
<p>
<i>But I may venture to say, That good Things are not always respected
as they ought to be: The People of the World will sometimes overlook a
Jewel, to avoid a T<span class = "hyphen">&#x2011;&#x2011;</span>d....
Nay, I&nbsp;have even found some of the </i>Spectator's<i> Works in a
Bog-house, Companions with Pocky-Bills and Fortune-telling
Advertisements....</i></p>
</div>

<p>In a series of essays in <i>The Spectator</i> (Nos. 58-61; May,
1711), Addison had earlier, of course, been at pains to distinguish
between "true wit" and "false wit." Particularly abhorrent to him was
the rebus. The first part of <i>The Merry-Thought</i> alone contains
seven rebuses from "<i>Drinking-Glasses, at a private Club of
Gentlemen</i>"
<span class = "pagenum intro">viii</span>
(pp. 12-13), as well as several examples of other kinds of "wit" which
Addison would have disdained.</p>

<p>During the twenty-five years that followed the publication of the
<i>Merry-Thought</i> series, a&nbsp;few additional pieces of graffiti
were published in England and America.<a class = "tag" name = "tag13" id
= "tag13" href = "#note13">13</a> In 1761 <i>The New Boghouse
Miscellany</i> appeared, but the contents of this book had little in
common with the <i>Merry-Thought</i> pamphlets. Only the scatological
humor of the subtitle:</p>

<div class = "block">
<p>
<i>A Companion for the Close-stool.</i> Consisting of Original Pieces in
Prose and Verse by several Modern Authors. Printed on an excellent soft
Paper; and absolutely necessary for all those, who read with a View to
Convenience, as well as Delight. Revised and corrected by a Gentleman
well skilled in the Fundamentals of Literature, near Privy-Garden</p>
</div>

<p>and the generally anti-intellectual thrust of its preface were
reminiscent of the <i>Merry-Thought</i> pamphlets. Not until the last
half of the twentieth century would the graffito in English receive the
kind of attention that had been paid it in England in the 1730s.</p>

Roberts was almost certainly the collector of the graffiti printed in
<i>The <ins class = "correction" title =
"text reads 'Marry'">Merry</ins>-Thought</i> as well as the author of the
dedication, but the dedication was itself signed with the name "Hurlo
Thrumbo." Similarly, the title-page listed Hurlo Thrumbo as the
publisher of the work. In 1729 <i>Hurlothrumbo: or, The
Super-Natural</i>, a&nbsp;play by a half-mad dancer and fiddler, Samuel
Johnson of Cheshire (1691-1773), had set all of London talking. The
irrational, amusing speeches and actions of Hurlothrumbo, the play's
title-character, gained instant fame, and two years later Roberts, by
attributing his collection to the labors of that celebrity, had every
reason to expect that the book would attract immediate attention. For a
detailed account of the relationship between Johnson's play and <i>The
Merry-Thought</i>, see George R. Guffey, "Graffiti, Hurlo Thrumbo, and
the Other Samuel Johnson," in <i>Forum: A&nbsp;Journal of the Humanities
and Fine Arts</i> (University of Houston), XVII (1979), 35-47.</p>

it not be great Pity, that the profound Learning and Wit of so many
illustrious Personages, who have favoured the Publick with their
Lucubrations in Diamond Characters upon <em>Drinking-Glasses</em>, on
<em>Windows</em>, on <em>Walls</em>, and in <em>Bog-houses</em>, should
be left to the World? Consider only, Gentlemen and Ladies, how many
Accidents might rob us of these sparkling Pieces, if the industrious
Care of the Collector had not taken this Way of preserving them, and
handing them to Posterity. In the first Place, some careless Drawer
breaks the Drinking-Glasses inscribed to the Beauties of our Age;
a&nbsp;furious Mob at an Election breaks the Windows of a contrary
Party; and a cleanly Landlord must have, forsooth, his Rooms new painted
and white-wash'd every now and then, without regarding in the least the
Wit and Learning he is obliterating, or the worthy Authors, any more
than when he shall have their Company: But I may venture to say, That
good Things are not always respected as they ought to be: The People of
the World will sometimes overlook a Jewel, to avoid a T<span class =
"dash">&mdash;</span>&mdash;d, though the Proverb says,
<em>Sh&#x2011;tt&#x2011;n Luck is good Luck</em>. <!--hmm, hadn't heard
that one--> Nay, I&nbsp;have even found some of the <em>Spectator</em>'s
Works in a Bog-house, Companion with Pocky-Bills and Fortune-telling
Advertisements; but now, as Dr. <em>R<span class =
"dash">&mdash;</span>&mdash;ff</em>
<span class = "pagenum">vi</span>
said, <em>You shall live</em>; and I dare venture to affirm, no Body
shall pretend to use any of your bright Compositions for Bum-Fodder, but
those who pay for them. I&nbsp;am not in this like many other
Publishers, who make the Works of other People their own, without
acknowledging the Piracy they are guilty of, or so much as paying the
least Complement to the Authors of their Wisdom: No, Gentlemen and
Ladies, I&nbsp;am not the Daw in the Fable, that would vaunt and strut
in your Plumes. And besides, I&nbsp;know very well you might have me
upon the Hank according to Law, and treat me as a Highwayman or Robber;
for you might safely swear upon your Honours, that I had stole the whole
Book from your recreative Minutes. But I am more generous; I&nbsp;am
what you may call Frank and Free; I&nbsp;acknowledge them to be <span
class = "smallcaps extended">Yours</span>, and now publish them to
perpetuate the Memory of your Honours Wit and Learning: But as every one
must have something of Self in him, I&nbsp;am violently flattered, that
my Character will shine like the Diamonds you wrote with, under your
exalted Protection, to the End of Time. I&nbsp;am not like your common
Dedicators, who fling out their Flourishes for the sake of a Purse of
Guineas on their Dedicatees; No, Gentlemen and Ladies, all I desire is,
that you will receive this kindly, though I have not put Cuts to it, and
